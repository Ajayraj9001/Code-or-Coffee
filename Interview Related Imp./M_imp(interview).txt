JavaScript Execution Context:- 

JavaScript EC means the JS file we made, how the file will run or Execute

Useally there are below types of Execution context:-

-> Global Execution Context
-> Function Execution Context
-> Eval Execution Context

Basically JS file run in 2 phase:-

1. Global Execution Phase:-
{code} -> Global Execution Context <- The Global EC is also to be putted into 'this' keyword

In Global Execution Phase the {code} has to be putted inside 'this' keyword.

Note:- Browser's execution context is always different from Node, Dino and all.

2. Memory Creation(Allocation) Phase:- In memory creation phase the memory size has been declared for the variables and function made in the code.

Note:- JS is single threaded language.

3. Execution Phase:- Execution phase defines how the code will execute in JS.

Suppose There is code given below

Code Example:-
" let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5
function addNum(num1, num2){
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total
}
let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
let result2 = addNum(10, 2) "

This Memory phase will do these below thing for the above example code:-

val1 -> undefined
val2 -> undefined
addNum -> defination
result1 -> undefined
result2 -> undefined

Imp Note:- Here the first cycle has done, in first cycle 2 staps(phases) comes 1st Global EC and 2nd Memory Phase.
